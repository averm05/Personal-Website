            Hii! My name is Advita Verma and I'm a Grade 12 aspiring to be an engineering! A few of my goals are: <br>
            - To get into mechatronics <br>
            - To do things I'm passionate about <br>
            - Enjoy senior year (but like after I get into uni :) <br>

                - Operator '25 (so much fun!!!)
                - Robotics is one of the main reasons I want to pursue mechatronics. There is something so special about getting to see your ideas and thoughts come to life and transform from a rough abstract idea to a 3D model to a life size fully working robot.
